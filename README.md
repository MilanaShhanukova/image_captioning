# ðŸ†Ž Image_captioning ðŸ“·

This is a repository for the final project in [Deep Learning School](https://www.dlschool.org/) about NLP spring 2021. Here I try to solve image captioning problem. 

The whole idea of image captioning is to create the description of one picture. In two architectures below I am using the method of first giving the picture to the model and then making generation according to it and the previously decoded state.

Creating this project I've used three articles: 
[Overview of image captioning models](https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2020/3062706.pdf)
[Show, Attend and Tell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf)
[Metrics for image captionin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07600.pdf)

In a few scipts you can find: 
* model - with and without attention mechanism 
* training pipeline
* metrics calculation 

The main part and ready project can be found in notebook. 

Here are some examples:
